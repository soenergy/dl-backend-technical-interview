# dl-backend-technical-interview 
This exercise is to see how you go about executing a relatively simple set of use cases 
in which you need to create a Ktor based Kotlin microservice that utilizes multiple sources 
of data in order to expose a simple RESTful JSON API.    

## Setup
- clone this git repository as this will form the base of your service
    - **you do not need to fork this repository**
    - **PR's will not be accepted on this repository**

## Exercise Detail
- you will need to create the following fully functional RESTful endpoints:
    - get a beer for a given ID
    - get ALL beers (no pagination is explicitly required)
    - search all beers for a given name    
    - add a beer
    - get a random beer 
    
- You have the following sources of data:
    - your [local resource file](https://github.com/soenergy/dl-backend-technical-interview/blob/main/resources/so-energy-beers.json)  
    - [The Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) (requires no authentication)
    - consumers of your own API! (via your own endpoint to add a beer)

- In order to accomplish this task you must
    - ingest data from the data-sources listed
    - consolidate the data from your various data sources such that you can create the necessary RESTful endpoints described above
        - feel free to assign your own identifiers internally however your implementation may require

- you are free to add any libraries you like to compliment the current project setup in order to complete the task at hand

- the JSON definition of a beer that your service should be using for the various endpoints you are exposing 
  [can be found within the resources](https://github.com/soenergy/dl-backend-technical-interview/blob/main/resources/beer-example/beer-example.json)  

## Notes

- The intention is for this test to take you no more than around Â±3 hours or so depending on 
  your familiarity with the Kotlin language and/or the tool
  
- Please structure your commits!
    - remember that the idea here is for us to be able to see how you go about tackling the problem, and a 
      commit that does one action is easier to follow than a commit that contains several actions. 

- please note that **we do not expect a full on database design & implementation**
    - the emphasis here is on the code itself, it would be more than sufficient to have in-memory only implementations 
      of any persistence interfaces you might otherwise have ordinarily setup  

- Your resulting project is going to be judged largely on the following merits:
    - the design of the external facing API your service is exposing 
    - the design of your internal system architecture  
        - clean architectural principles
        - how you go about modeling the data that you consume vs the data you expose and mapping  
    - testing!
        - how testable your service is 
        - where you focus your testing efforts
        
- your service implementation will form the basis of our final stage interview

- should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us

## Delivering your finished project
- zip up your entire local git project
- send us the zipped-up git project
